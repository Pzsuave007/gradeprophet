## Best Offer Auto-Accept/Auto-Decline Rules
- User sets percentages in Account → "Best Offer Rules" section
- `auto_decline_pct` (e.g. 70): reject offers below 70% of price
- `auto_accept_pct` (e.g. 10): accept offers within 10% of price
- Automatically applied to new listings with Best Offer enabled
- Bulk apply to selected listings in Listings module (with editable percentages)
- Bulk apply to ALL active listings from Account
- Uses eBay `<MinimumBestOfferPrice>` and `<BestOfferAutoAcceptPrice>` with `currencyID="USD"`

## eBay Strategy Launcher
- 3-step wizard in Schedule tab:
  1. Select cards from unlisted inventory
  2. Pick which cards are auctions (tap to toggle) + set prices (auto-lookup or manual)
  3. Configure settings (auction start %, decline %, accept %, batch size) + launch
- Auctions: 1/day, 7-day duration, starting bid = X% of comp
- Fixed Price: batches of N/day, Best Offer enabled with auto-decline/accept rules
- All scheduled at 7pm Central (midnight UTC)
- Endpoint: `POST /api/schedule/launch-strategy`

## Listing Title Format
- Player name FIRST, then card details: "Stephen Curry 2024 Topps Chrome #45"
- Applied in `generate_listing_title()` in ebay.py and used by schedule worker

## Key API Endpoints
- `POST /api/schedule/launch-strategy` — Launch eBay strategy
- `POST /api/schedule/add-bulk` — Schedule multiple cards
- `POST /api/ebay/sell/bulk-apply-offer-rules` — Apply Best Offer rules to selected listings
- `POST /api/ebay/sell/bulk-update-best-offer-rules` — Apply rules to ALL active listings
- `PUT /api/settings` — Save best_offer_auto_decline_pct, best_offer_auto_accept_pct
- `POST /api/ebay/sell/create` — Create listing (auto-applies Best Offer rules)

- **Apr 19 2026**: Fixed Schedule Queue disappearing bug — cards persist across tab navigation.
- **Apr 20 2026**: Fixed auction/fixed-price stacking bug in `/api/schedule/add-bulk` — separate calls now correctly compute next free slot based on existing pending/processing posts (auctions: +1 day each; fixed price: fills day up to batch_size then rolls over).
- **Apr 20 2026**: Fixed card "returning to inventory" bug — `/api/inventory/stats` and `/api/schedule/sync-scheduled-flags` auto-sync was wiping `scheduled=True` flag on cards whose posts moved from `pending` → `failed`. Now treats `failed` posts as still-scheduled so the card stays in the Schedule tab until the user retries or deletes manually.
- **Apr 20 2026**: Added **Retry** button on failed posts (`POST /api/schedule/{post_id}/retry`) → reschedules ~2 min from now and resets status to `pending`. Added **Clear Failed** bulk action (`DELETE /api/schedule/bulk/clear-failed?queue_type=…`) to clean up history. Individual delete icon also available per failed post.
- **Apr 20 2026**: Prevented past-dating of schedules — `/api/schedule/add-bulk` now rolls `start_day` forward by full days whenever the chosen start/hour is already in the past, so the worker never processes an auction/listing instantly on refresh. Worker now also clears `scheduled=False` on successful post, giving a clean Schedule → Listings transition.
- **Apr 20 2026**: Fixed CT→UTC date conversion for late-evening hours. Previously, picking `start_date = today` + `post_hour = 9pm CT` computed a UTC timestamp **on the wrong UTC calendar day** (the 5-hour offset rolls into next UTC day). This made the "past-date protection" incorrectly push valid future schedules to tomorrow. Now `add-bulk`, `launch-strategy` both apply a `day_shift = (hour + 5) // 24` so same-day evening schedules land correctly.
- **Apr 20 2026**: Fixed frontend default `start_date` in `AddToScheduleView` — previously used `new Date().toISOString()` which returns UTC date. When user is in CT at 7pm+, UTC is already "tomorrow", so the picker showed tomorrow's CT date as default. Now defaults to today's **CT date** (shift `-5h` before split).
- **Apr 20 2026**: Made `/api/schedule/add-bulk` backend robust to old frontend caches. Uses real Python `timezone(-5h)` and detects when the sent `start_date` matches UTC-today while CT is still yesterday (= browser cache sending UTC date instead of CT) and auto-corrects to CT-today. Same-day evening scheduling now works regardless of which frontend version the browser has cached.
- **Apr 20 2026**: Fixed edge case where 2 auctions added in separate bulk calls with different `post_minute` ended up on the same day (violating the 1/day auction rule). The existing-post check was comparing by full datetime instead of just by date → minutes were skipping the check. Now compares `ed.date() >= start_day.date()` so the second auction correctly rolls to the next day.
- **Apr 20 2026**: Removed 1-auction/day rule in manual Add Cards. Users can now schedule multiple auctions the same day at their chosen times (critical for weekends when buyer traffic peaks). Rule still enforced in Strategy Launcher for automated campaigns. Collision protection: if two auctions pick the exact same time, second one auto-shifts +10 min.
- **Apr 20 2026**: Fixed scanner crop cutting the top of the card. `scanner_auto_process` previously had a hardcoded `TOP_CUT=240` designed to remove a 240px "Gem Mint" label. New scans without that label were losing ~218px of the card's top (name area / player image). Now dynamically detects where the card's white border begins (via bright-row scan over the middle 60% of width) and cuts down to that row minus a 20px margin, capped at 320px.
