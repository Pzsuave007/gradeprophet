## Subscription Plans (Current)
- **Rookie** (Free)
- **MVP** ($14.99/mo)
- **Hall of Famer** ($19.99/mo)
- Old plan IDs migrated: all_star→mvp, hall_of_fame→hall_of_famer, legend→hall_of_famer

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Fixed Auto-Crop**: Top 240px, Left/Right/Bottom 40px. DO NOT revert to AI/Canny detection.
- **eBay XML payloads**: Uses Trading API (XML) for listings, Marketing API (REST) for promotions.
- **Auth**: Google Auth. DO NOT modify auth system.
- **AI Team Extraction**: CARD_IDENTIFY_PROMPT now includes "team" field.

## CRITICAL BUILD RULES (READ BEFORE EVERY BUILD)
- **NEVER run `craco build` or `yarn build` directly**. ALWAYS use `bash /app/build_prod.sh`
- Production URL is `https://flipslabengine.com` — this MUST be baked into the frontend build
- The `.env` file has the Emergent preview URL for local testing ONLY — it must NEVER leak into production builds
- `build_prod.sh` overrides REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL to the production URL and verifies no preview URL leaks
- **DO NOT change auth.py Google OAuth endpoints** — they use Emergent Auth service which is correct
- `ensure_admin_password()` in server.py fixes admin password on every startup (prevents fork login issues)

## Completed Features

### Session - Feb 2026 (Pick Your Card Feature + Bulk Savings)
- New "Pick Your Card" multi-variation listing: one eBay listing with dropdown where buyers pick which card they want
- Each card = one variation with its own photo, price, and quantity
- "Set All Prices" bulk button + individual price editing per card
- **Bulk Savings (Volume Discount)**: Configurable tiers (Buy 2+ = X% off, Buy 3+ = Y% off) via eBay Marketing API
- Auto-applied after listing creation via `POST /sell/marketing/v1/item_promotion`
- Backend: `create-pick-your-card` + `volume-discount` endpoints
- Frontend: `CreatePickYourCardView.jsx` with tier management UI and price preview
- Integrated into Inventory as green "You Pick" button

### Session - Feb 2026 (Create Lot Feature + Fix)
- Backend logic for "Create Lot" (Collage generator in `image.py`, new eBay lot endpoint)
- Frontend `CreateLotView` full-page component (replaced popup modal) with correct eBay CONDITIONS (400010-400013) and SHIPPING_OPTIONS (Free/PWE/FirstClass/Priority)
- Backend: Fixed ConditionID to use 4000 + ConditionDescriptors (matching single-listing flow), fixed shipping XML
- Fixed "improper words" eBay error by removing "Lot" from title/description (blocked in Singles category 261328)
- Combined front+back images side by side (left=front, right=back) instead of separate uploads
- Collages: max 4 cards per collage, 2 per row
- Max cards per lot increased from 10 to 15
- Regenerate Images feature: in Listings tab, lot listings show "Regenerate & Upload Images" button to re-create and push updated images to eBay via ReviseFixedPriceItem
- **Fixed P0 crash**: `CreateLotModal` was rendered in wrong scope. Converted to full-page `CreateLotView`.

### Session - Feb 2026 (eBay Cassini SEO)
- Expanded Item Specifics for new eBay listings (20+ fields): Type, Year Manufactured, Card Size, Country, Language, Original/Reprint, Vintage, Autographed, Card Name, League, Manufacturer, Parallel/Variety, Features, Custom Bundle, Material, Team, Print Run, Signed By
- `build_item_specifics()` helper in ebay.py
- `extract_manufacturer()` to parse brand from set_name
- `POST /api/ebay/sell/bulk-revise-specifics` endpoint for bulk updating existing listings
- "Specifics" bulk action button in ListingsModule.jsx
- Fixed Signed By (always = player name), Team (from inventory), Print Run (from /XX in variation)
- Updated AI prompt to extract `team` field, added `team` to inventory models

### Session - Feb 2026 (Promoted Listings Standard)
- **Campaign Management**: Create, pause, resume, end, delete PLS campaigns
- **Bulk Promote/Remove**: Add/remove listings from campaigns in bulk
- **Campaign View**: Grid view of promoted listings with ad rate, status, and remove button
- **AD Badge**: Orange "AD" badge on promoted listings in the main grid
- **Endpoints**: GET /promoted/campaigns, POST /promoted/create-campaign, POST /promoted/bulk-add, POST /promoted/bulk-remove, GET /promoted/campaign/{id}/ads, POST /promoted/campaign/{id}/pause|resume|end, DELETE /promoted/campaign/{id}, POST /promoted/campaign/{id}/remove-ads

### Session - Feb 2026 (UI/UX Improvements)
- Bulk action buttons (Shipping, Condition, Best Offer, Specifics, Promote) always visible in both ListingsModule and InventoryModule (disabled until Select mode)
- Auto-refresh on browser tab visibility change (not polling timer)
- CreateListingView calls onSuccess() after publishing to refresh data
- Admin Panel completely redesigned: large user cards, text labels on all buttons, clickable plan badges, stats grid, plan distribution bars, confirm modals, 3 clear tabs (Users/Transactions/Presets)

### Session - Feb 2026 (Admin Fixes)
- Fixed valid_plans from old 4-plan to new 3-plan system
- Fixed PLAN_ALIASES: hall_of_fame→hall_of_famer (was incorrectly mvp)
- Migrated all DB subscriptions to new plan IDs
- Fixed admin stats to normalize old plan IDs
- Fixed Scans count: now = inventory count (every card scanned by AI)
- Fixed Listings count: now uses listings_cache.active_total (synced from eBay)
- Added Total eBay Listings to global stats

### Session - Feb 2026 (Store Promotions Management + Login Fix)
- **Store Promotions List**: Fetches active/scheduled/paused ORDER_DISCOUNT promotions from eBay Marketing API (`GET /sell/marketing/v1/promotion`)
- **Pause/Resume/Delete**: Full lifecycle management of store promotions via eBay Marketing API
- Backend endpoints: `GET /api/ebay/sell/store-promotions`, `POST .../pause`, `POST .../resume`, `DELETE ...`
- Frontend: Updated `StorePromotions.jsx` with collapsible create form, active promotions list with status badges, and action buttons
- **Permanent Login Fix**: Added `ensure_admin_password()` to `server.py` startup that verifies and corrects admin password hash on every boot, preventing recurring fork login issues
